# DARP: Divide Areas Algorithm for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning #

This project deals with the path planning problem of a team of mobile robots, in order to cover an area of interest, with prior-defined obstacles.

DARP algorithm divides the terrain into a number of equal areas each corresponding to a specific robot, so as to guarantee complete coverage, non-backtracking solution, minimum coverage path, while at the same time does not need any preparatory stage.
